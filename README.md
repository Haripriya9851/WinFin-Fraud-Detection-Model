# WinFin: Analytics Problem Statement and Leadership Requirements

Hello, As part of my Leadership in Analytics class final project, i have ideated on building a FinTech company and how analytics can be used as a change agent in my business. I propose on integrating a sophisticated fraud detection ML model into WinFin transaction system, enhancing security, user trust, and overall business impact.

**WinFin, short for "Win in Finances"** is a FinTech company that provide a unified platform that offers payment solutions, budgeting
assistance, investment guidance, and strategies to boost savings. Targeted at diverse
consumers, from tech-savvy professionals to unbanked populations, WinFin aims to
simplify financial management and provide accessible, comprehensive financial services. 

CRISP-DM, CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is a robust and well-
proven methodology, to plan the steps in the data mining process. It breaks data
mining problem into 6 phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data 
Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation and Deployment. Now, Let’s employ CRIP-DM to
understand and plan on how WinFin’s can employ data mining for fraud detection. 

To deep dive on how my navigated the requirements for each phase, please refer the Report here: [WinFin: Analytics Problem Statement and
Leadership Requirements](https://github.com/Haripriya9851/WinFin-Fraud-Detection-Model/blob/main/ALY6120_Assignment6_HariPriyaR.pdf)

Below is the CRISP-DM steps summary on how i will plan on integrating the sophisticated model into the transaction system.

# WinFin Fraud Detection: CRISP-DM Summary
**•Business & Data Understanding:** WinFin aims to establish itself as a trusted leader
in the FinTech industry by focusing on staying ahead of the competition, building
user trust, and enhancing user experience. By focusing on security and user-centric
innovations, WinFin can establish itself as a trusted leader in the fintech industry.

**•Data Preparation:** To effectively identify and predict fraudulent activities, the model
requires a comprehensive dataset including —transactional, user, financial,
behavioral, and external sources.

**• Modeling:** Neural networks are chosen for their superior ability to recognize
complex, non-linear patterns and adapt to evolving fraud tactics, despite requiring
significant computational resources.

**• Evaluation:** The objective of WinFin’s detection system is to detect as much as fraud
transactions proactively as possible. Sensitivity is the key that ensures fraudulent
transactions are correctly identified and maximize the true positives.

**• Deployment:** Deployment integrates the cloud-based model to includes API
development and system compatibility. Ensure real-time processing and scalability.
Monitor, retrain, document, train, and prepare rollback plans.

By leveraging advanced analytics, effective leadership, collaboration among Data
engineer, data scientists, IT Team, Fraud analysts and the right methodologies, WinFin
can successfully integrate a sophisticated fraud detection model into its transaction
system, enhancing security, user trust, and overall business impact.
